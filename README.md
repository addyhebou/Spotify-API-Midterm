# Spotify-API-Midterm
This Spotify API allows you to sign into your Spotify account and display a player of what you are currently playing.

Display the two sources of data in the same UI
Have the UI be interactive
Have the UI change based on the data
Have the site styled

1 and 2) The Spotify API is extracting all of its data from the JSON file that Spotify provides for each current song. Additionally, the equalizer Gif is a downloaded animation to contribute to mood. All data is shown on the main client page.

3) The UI allows users to login to Spotify and authorize the account to display data. Additionally, the app allows users to refresh the player to update the current song.

4) As songs change, the song name, artwork, and background will subsequently change to match the current record.

5) The sit is styled to model the "Topic" brand used on Youtube to display audio from recording artists.
